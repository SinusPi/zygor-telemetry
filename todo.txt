Now, each Cruncher def can have subdefs, but that doesn't create a proper "topic" for View and Endpoint.
Need to treat sub-crunchers as Topics.
Or extract the cruncher part from them?

Adding a new Topic must reprocess all relevant source material; source files must be therefore marked as "already processed" PER TOPIC.
